    "- I first sort the edges by the weights then iterate through the edges and add the first edge that has a source in my mstSet (minimum spanning tree) list and a destination in the neighbors of the vertices in my list (since the edges are sorted, the first one will be the minimum). Edges with a source in the neighbors and destination in mst can also be added. Then I add the neighbors of the new vertex into my neighbors list. I repeat until all the vertices are in mst. The time complexity is O(n^3) because there are 3 nested loops."
